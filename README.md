# HouseSalesPrice-project
Welcome! The code, analysis, and resulting documentation in this repository detail my attempt at the Kaggle competition titled House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). It was also overall my first attempt at a data science project from end to end, and was my first time using Kaggle. This project was conducted for my Technology Fundamentals for Business Analytics class project in Fall 2017.

## Goals
The goals of this project was to get myself accustomed to the process of executing a data science project from data understanding, to cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and modelling. I really wanted to be able to finish this project with a good level of "data science literacy". What I mean by this is, not necessarily knowing all of the models, packages, and go to tactics for handling messy data, but at least coming out of the project with the ability to understand others' approaches and the ability to understand and do quick study on data science jargon that I would not necessarily know about.

## Major Takeaways
This was a good starter project to get my feet into the water. My major takeways include learning about a lot of the foundational data exploration techniques and thought processes that are needed to iterate through data science projects (i.e. what to do with missing variables, what to do about categorical variables, do certain fields make sense to include in modelling, etc.), and also learning how to understand notebooks written by community peers on the Kaggle platform. The platform itself is really open source and fosters a great space for learning, which definitely increased my appreciation of the science.

## Installation
It is important to note that my project activities, especially for this class, were hosted on a cloud docker container hosted by my professor that had alot of the basic dependencies already included in the environment. All of the required packages needed to run each of the notebooks has always been listed at the very top of each Jupyter Notebook so that viewers will know what tools I used.

## Running the Notebooks & Reviewing My Analysis
I have included the accompanying train and test datasets from the House Sales competition Kaggle page directly into an input folder in the repository. The data is linked into the Jupyter notebooks to be run. In addition, since Part 1 and Part 2 of the project were conducted at separate time points within the semester, it will be best if the documentation analysis and jupyter notebook for a particular part of the project are viewed concurrently. I reference figures in my analysis from its companion notebook.
